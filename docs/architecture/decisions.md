# Morpho Technical Decisions

## 2026-06-23: Use Next.js App Router

Decision: use `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` for the formal application foundation.

Reason: Morpho needs a production-oriented TypeScript application in the existing project root without creating a temporary project.

Current scope: App Router pages and route handlers run in one application. No separate backend service is implemented.

## 2026-06-23: Use tldraw as the Canvas SDK

Decision: use `tldraw` for the real canvas layer.

Reason: Morpho needs pan, zoom, selection, and extensible canvas object rendering. A custom `morpho-object` shape bridges tldraw canvas instances to Morpho domain objects.

Boundary: canvas coordinates are stored only as visual placement in `canvas.instances`. Domain semantics remain in Morpho objects and relations.

## 2026-06-23: Use Vitest for Domain Boundary Tests

Decision: use `vitest` for deterministic tests.

Reason: Morpho product rules require automated tests for object relations, state changes, delivery references, AI context boundaries, persistence migration, provider adapters, and import behavior.

## 2026-06-23: Use lucide-react for Interface Icons

Decision: use `lucide-react` for compact toolbar, rail, AI, and detail icons.

Reason: the app needs recognizable icon buttons without adding a large UI component system.

## 2026-06-23: Pin ESLint to 9.x

Decision: use `eslint@^9.39.0` with `eslint-config-next@16.2.9`.

Reason: `eslint@10.5.0` installed by `latest` triggered a runtime incompatibility in the React rule stack used by `eslint-config-next`. ESLint 9 satisfies Next's peer dependency and lint runs successfully.

## 2026-06-23: Use Schema Version 2 for Core Workspace Semantics

Decision: introduce visibility, delivery references, and scoped decision records.

Reason: Morpho needs structural separation between visibility, deletion, direction state, default references, and delivery references before adding project entry, import, AI, or export behavior.

Implemented fields include object `visibility`, `deliveryReferences`, and scoped `decisionRecords`.

## 2026-06-23: Keep Decision Records Semantic

Decision: `DecisionRecord` is not a universal operation log.

Reason: hidden and restore actions are temporary workspace operations and should not pollute decision history. Decision records are reserved for project-level decisions such as default-reference changes, direction status changes, delivery-reference changes, and reasoned deletion.

## 2026-06-23: Snapshot Delivery References

Decision: delivery modules store `DeliveryReference` IDs, and each delivery reference stores a display snapshot.

Reason: delivery content must remain stable when its source object is renamed, hidden, deleted, replaced by a new default reference, or continued into a new version.

## 2026-06-23: Preserve Raw localStorage on Migration Failure

Decision: localStorage migration is pure, and failed migration does not overwrite stored raw data.

Reason: localStorage is temporary, but it already represents real local project state. Future database or sync migration should follow the same rule: migration failure must be recoverable and must not silently reset project data to seed content.

## 2026-06-24: Use Schema Version 3 for Local Projects and Assets

Decision: upgrade workspace data to `schemaVersion: 3`.

Reason: Milestone 2 needs multi-project local persistence, asset records, text/link/image collection objects, persisted UI state, and extended AI messages while preserving v2 semantic boundaries.

Implemented fields include `workspace.assets`, `workspace.ui`, `TextObject`, `LinkObject`, and `ImageCollectionObject`.

## 2026-06-24: Use localStorage for Project Catalog and Workspace JSON

Decision: store the local project catalog and each workspace JSON document in localStorage.

Reason: the current product is local-first and must run without Supabase, authentication, cloud storage, or a configured backend database.

Boundary: localStorage stores structured project state only. Binary assets are stored separately in IndexedDB.

## 2026-06-24: Use IndexedDB for Local Binary Assets

Decision: store imported and generated binary files as Blobs in native IndexedDB.

Reason: images, PDFs, and other files must survive refresh without putting base64 payloads in localStorage.

Boundary: current code records asset metadata and Blob storage keys but does not implement garbage collection.

## 2026-06-24: Use Server-Side MiMo Adapter for Text Chat

Decision: implement `/api/ai/chat` as a server-side route that reads `MORPHO_MIMO_*` and calls MiMo through an OpenAI-compatible streaming adapter.

Reason: API keys must not appear in browser code, localStorage, logs, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.

Boundary: MiMo can return text analysis, suggestions, and drafts only. It cannot directly mutate Morpho project state.

## 2026-06-24: Use Server-Side GrsAI Adapter for Image Generation

Decision: implement `/api/ai/image` as a server-side route that reads `MORPHO_GRS_*`, calls GrsAI `POST /v1/api/generate`, polls `GET /v1/api/result?id=...` when required, downloads the remote result, and returns image bytes to the browser.

Reason: image generation needs a real provider path while keeping keys server-only and preserving local-first asset storage.

Boundary: generated images are saved by the browser as new IndexedDB assets and new Morpho image objects. The source image, default reference, version chain, and delivery references are not overwritten.

## 2026-06-24: Keep GrsAI Model Request Profiles Separate

Decision: GrsAI request defaults are selected by server-side model profile and a client-safe static image model catalog.

Reason: native `nano-banana-*` and `gpt-image-2` do not use the same request shape. `nano-banana-2` uses `imageSize: "1K"` and `replyType: "json"`, while `gpt-image-2` uses pixel-style `aspectRatio`, `replyType: "json"`, and no `imageSize`.

Boundary: browser code does not expose API keys or base URL, and it does not build provider-private request bodies. The image task UI sends only model ID, aspect ratio, optional size option, prompt, and explicit references. The server adapter normalizes requests before calling GrsAI.

## 2026-06-24: Default GrsAI Image Model to `nano-banana-fast`

Decision: use a static GrsAI image model catalog and default to `nano-banana-fast`.

Reason: the current provider documentation does not expose a model-list endpoint for Morpho to consume, and the supplied provider model list marks `nano-banana-fast` as the lowest-point available image model. Maintenance and text/recognition models are not exposed in the image-generation selector.

Boundary: model points are displayed as provider points only. Morpho does not present RMB price estimates as authoritative; the UI says fees are subject to the provider console.

## 2026-06-24: Store Intrinsic Image Dimensions and Generation Metadata

Decision: store optional `width`, `height`, and `aspectRatio` on `AssetRecord`, and store generation metadata on generated image objects.

Reason: generated and imported images need consistent canvas sizing without cropping, and generated results must remain traceable to the chosen model, prompt, ratio, size option, references, and direction.

Boundary: metadata is shown in the bottom detail surface, not stacked on canvas cards. The selected model, ratio, and size option affect only the current generation request and are not written into project memory or default reference state.

## 2026-06-24: Keep MiMo Text Chat Metadata-Only for Images

Decision: the MiMo text chat route explicitly does not send image pixels yet.

Reason: until MiMo official visual input support is implemented in the provider adapter, Morpho must not present text chat as true image analysis.

Boundary: image objects can appear as metadata summaries in MiMo context. A sanitized attachment summary boundary exists for future visual-input conversion, but the current MiMo provider messages remain text-only.
